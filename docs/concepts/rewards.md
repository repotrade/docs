## Rewards

The purpose of repo.trade is to provide a stream of funding to software developers that implement popular open source software.

### Fee Distribution

50/50 Split

The fees collected on Repo.Trade are divided equally between two parties:

1. Protocol Fees: 50% of the fees go to the Repo.Trade protocol.
2. Owner Fees: 50% of the fees go to the verified owner of the repository.

This equal distribution ensures that:

- The protocol can sustain and improve its services.
- Repository owners are incentivized to participate and maintain their projects.

### Owner Verification

To claim owner fees, repository owners must go through a verification process:

1. Owners need to authenticate through GitHub.
2. This process verifies their ownership of the repository.
3. Only after successful verification can owners claim their share of the fees.

Fee Accumulation and Claiming

- Owner fees accumulate in the repository's account.
- Verified owners can claim these fees periodically and at any time.
- Unclaimed fees remain in the repository's account until claimed.
- As long as a repository has no owner, the owner rewards will continue to accumulate

### Importance of Verification

The verification process through GitHub serves several purposes:

- Ensures that fees are distributed to legitimate repository owners.
- Prevents unauthorized claims on repository fees.
- Maintains the integrity and trust in the Repo.Trade ecosystem.

!!! warning

Currently only **personal** accounts can verify their repositories.
Organizational repositories will be supported in a future update.

### Conclusion

The 50/50 fee split between the protocol and repository owners, coupled with the GitHub verification process, creates a fair and secure environment in Repo.Trade. This structure incentivizes both platform development and active participation of project owners, fostering a sustainable and growing ecosystem.
