# WTF is repo.trade?

Repos, in the context of **repo.trade**, are revolutionary blockchain-based tokens that represent ownership and value of a specific GitHub repository. When a project is pushed to GitHub, a unique token is automatically minted for that repository. This system brings numerous benefits:

- **Financial Incentives**: Creators earn passive income as their project's token value increases, allowing them to focus on development.
- **Community Engagement**: Token holders become stakeholders, fostering a more involved and motivated community.
- **Project Promotion**: Tokens incentivize users and investors to actively promote and contribute to the project's success.

Developers and users should be ecstatic about this innovation as it transforms open-source development into a sustainable, rewarding ecosystem where everyone's efforts are aligned towards mutual success! ðŸš€âœ¨
