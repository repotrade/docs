## How repo.trade Works Under the Hood

### Auction and Swaps

When a new repository token is minted on repo.trade, it can be auctioned off to the highest bidder. This initial auction sets the token's starting value. Post-auction, tokens can be freely traded through swaps on the platform.

### Trading Fees

Each trade incurs a small fee. These fees accumulate in a pool associated with each repository. Once verified by the platform, these fees are rewarded to the repository owner, creating an ongoing revenue stream for developers.

By integrating auctions and swaps with trading fees, repo.trade ensures that creators are continuously supported while fostering an active trading environment that benefits both developers and investors.
